# Analytics Engineering: Session 1

## Introduction to Analytics Engineering & Course Overview

---

## Agenda

- Course logistics & the project you will build
- What is Analytics Engineering?
- The Analytics Development Lifecycle (ADLC)
- ELT vs ETL
- Data Team Roles & the Modern Data Stack
- What is dbt?
- The dbt ecosystem
- Certification overview

---

## Course Logistics

**15 sessions**, structured around the **8 domains** of the dbt Analytics Engineering Certification.

- **Concept sessions**: theory + live coding on the course repo.
- **Hands-on workshops**: Sessions **5, 8, and 12** — you build, I coach.
- **Certification prep**: Sessions 14 (Q&A) and 15 (exam strategy).

**Tools we will use**:

- **dbt Core** (local, open-source), **DuckDB** as the warehouse.
- **VS Code** + the **dbt Power User** extension.
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration.
- **Python** for the environment manager (`uv`) and Python models.

---

## The Course Project

You will build a **complete, production-style dbt project** on an ecommerce dataset.

- **Dataset**: 14 raw tables (orders, customers, products, shipments…) loaded from Parquet into DuckDB.
- **Three-layer architecture**: `staging → intermediate → marts`.
- **Production features** (added progressively): tests, documentation, packages, macros, incremental models, snapshots, contracts, CI/CD patterns.
- **Workflow**: fork the course repo, then work entirely inside **your fork** — feature branches, Pull Requests into your fork's `main`, no pushes to the instructor's repo.

*By the end of the course you will have a portfolio-ready dbt project and be ready for the certification exam.*

## What is Analytics Engineering?

A discipline that applies **software engineering principles** to data transformation.

- **The Practices**: Version control (Git), CI/CD, Automated Testing, Modular Code.
- **The Gap**: Bridges the gap between Data Engineering (Infrastructure/Ingestion) and Data Analysis (Insights/Reporting).
- **The Outcome**: Trusted, documented, and reliable datasets that the business can depend on.

---

## The Analytics Development Lifecycle (ADLC)

The ADLC is the workflow that analytics engineers follow to deliver trustworthy data.

1. **Build**: Write modular, tested transformations.
2. **Collaborate**: Version control, code review, and documentation.
3. **Deploy**: Push to production with CI/CD.
4. **Monitor**: Track data freshness, test results, and pipeline health.

*dbt is designed around the ADLC — it provides tools for every stage.*

## ELT vs ETL

The modern data stack flips the traditional approach.

| | **ETL** (Traditional) | **ELT** (Modern) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Transform** | Before loading (in a staging area) | After loading (in the warehouse) |
| **Tools** | Informatica, SSIS | dbt, SQL |
| **Scalability** | Limited by staging compute | Leverages warehouse compute |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid, schema-first | Agile, iterate quickly |

**dbt is the "T" in ELT** — it transforms data already in your warehouse.

## Data Team Roles

---

## Where the Analytics Engineer Fits

- **Data Engineer**: Builds pipelines (Extract & Load). Focuses on infrastructure.
- **Analytics Engineer**: Transforms data (the "T"). Focuses on modeling, testing, docs.
- **Data Analyst**: Consumes data. Focuses on insights and reporting.

The Analytics Engineer sits between Engineering and Analysis, ensuring data is **reliable, documented, and queryable**.

---

## The Modern Data Stack

![center width:1200px](../img/data_stack.png)

A layered ecosystem: **ingest → store → transform → serve**. dbt owns the *transform* layer.

---

## What is dbt?

**dbt** is the transformation workflow that lets you quickly and collaboratively deploy analytics code.

- **The "T" in ELT**: dbt doesn't extract or load data. It transforms data already in your warehouse.
- **Compiler**: Compiles Jinja (templating) and SQL into raw SQL.
- **Runner**: Executes that SQL against your database (DuckDB, Snowflake, etc.).
- **The Data Control Plane**: Manages testing, documentation, and lineage in one place.

---

## The dbt Ecosystem

dbt is the **de-facto standard** for transformation in the Modern Data Stack.

- **Community**: Thousands of professionals in the [dbt Slack](https://www.getdbt.com/community/join-the-community) — channels for DuckDB, testing, dbt Cloud, job postings, and more.
- **Packages (dbt Hub)**: `dbt_utils`, `dbt_expectations`, `codegen`, `dbt_project_evaluator` — reusable macros and tests maintained by the community.
- **Warehouses**: Official adapters for Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks, Postgres, **DuckDB**, and more.
- **Integrations**: Fivetran & Airbyte (ingestion), Airflow/Dagster/Prefect (orchestration), Looker/Tableau/Metabase (BI).
- **Career**: "Analytics Engineer" is one of the fastest-growing roles in data.

---

## Certification Overview

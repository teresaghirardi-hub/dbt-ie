## Introduction to DuckDB

**Why DuckDB?**

- **"SQLite for analytics"**: an in-process SQL OLAP database.
- **Serverless**: no server to install, configure, or maintain.
- **Fast**: columnar storage, vectorized execution — optimized for analytical queries.
- **Integrated**: reads Parquet/CSV directly, works natively with Python and dbt.

In this course, **DuckDB acts as our Data Warehouse**, running locally on your machine. The file `my_database.duckdb` *is* our warehouse.

---

## Setting up the Environment

We use **`uv`** as the Python package manager — fast, modern, and reproducible.

1. **Sync dependencies** (reads `pyproject.toml`, creates `.venv/`, writes `uv.lock`):
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1     # Windows PowerShell
   ```

3. **Install dbt packages** (from `packages.yml`):
   ```bash
   dbt deps
   ```

*Tip: you can skip activation and prefix any command with `uv run`, e.g. `uv run dbt debug`.*

---

## Setting up the Database

We load the raw Parquet files into DuckDB with a helper script:

```bash
python create_db.py
```

This creates `my_database.duckdb` with 14 raw tables: `customers`, `orders`, `order_items`, `products`, `shipping`, `payments`, `reviews`, and more.

**Verify the dbt connection**:
```bash
dbt debug
```

If everything is green, you are ready to build.

---

## Git Workflow: Forking & Cloning

All your work lives inside **your own fork**. Nothing gets pushed back to the instructor's repo.

1. **Fork** `dgarhdez/dbt-ie` on GitHub — this creates `YOUR_USERNAME/dbt-ie`, which you own and can push to.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dbt-ie.git
   ```
3. **Branch** for each piece of work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-first-model
   ```
4. **Commit, push, and open a PR** *inside your fork* (feature branch → your own `main`). Merge it yourself.

*Same PR-based workflow used in industry — just scoped to your fork.*

---

## The VS Code IDE

We use **Visual Studio Code** as our Integrated Development Environment.

**Recommended extensions**:

- **Python** — run scripts and manage environments.
- **dbt Power User** (by Innoverio) — dbt-specific features.
- **SQLTools** + **SQLTools DuckDB driver** — query the warehouse directly.
- **Rainbow CSV** — readable CSV previews.

---

## The dbt Power User Extension

Bridges the gap between your code and dbt execution.

**Install**: Extensions view (`Cmd+Shift+X`) → search "dbt Power User" → Install.

**Features you will use daily**:

- **Go to Definition** — `Cmd+Click` on a `ref()` to jump to the referenced model.
- **Query Preview** — run the current model's SQL against DuckDB without a full `dbt run`.
- **Compiled SQL panel** — see the compiled output live.
- **Lineage view** — visualize upstream/downstream dependencies.

---

## The dbt Project Structure

Every dbt project is defined by **`dbt_project.yml`** at the repo root.

```yaml
name: 'dbt_ie'
version: '1.0.0'
profile: 'default'          # which profile from profiles.yml to use

model-paths:    ["models"]
seed-paths:     ["seeds"]
macro-paths:    ["macros"]
snapshot-paths: ["snapshots"]
test-paths:     ["tests"]

models:
  dbt_ie:
    staging:
      materialized: view    # default materialization for models/staging/
```

The `models:` section lets you configure defaults **by folder**, cascading down.

---

└── logs/                   # dbt run logs (gitignored)
```

---

## Building Your First Model

A **dbt model** is a `SELECT` statement saved as a `.sql` file under `models/`.

```sql
-- models/staging/stg_customers.sql
select
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    country
from main.customers
```

Build it:
```bash
dbt run -s stg_customers
```

*We read directly from `main.customers` for now. Next session we will wrap raw tables with `source()` for proper lineage.*

---

## The `ref()` Macro & Modularity

`ref()` is how models reference each other — it is the core of dbt's **DAG**.

```sql
-- models/intermediate/int_customer_orders.sql
select
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    count(o.order_id) as n_orders
from {{ ref('stg_customers') }} as c
left join {{ ref('stg_orders') }}    as o
    on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
group by 1, 2
```

- dbt resolves `ref()` to the correct schema/table **at compile time**.
- It builds a **Directed Acyclic Graph** of all models.
- It determines the correct **execution order** automatically.

---

## Why `ref()` Matters

Without `ref()`:

```sql
-- brittle: hardcoded schema, no dependency tracking
from main.stg_customers
```

With `ref()`:

```sql
from {{ ref('stg_customers') }}
```

- **Portable**: same code works across dev, staging, and prod schemas.
- **DAG-aware**: dbt knows to build `stg_customers` *before* any model that refs it.
- **Safe refactoring**: rename a model → dbt flags every downstream consumer.

## Key dbt Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `dbt debug` | Verify connection and project configuration |
| `dbt deps` | Install packages from `packages.yml` |
| `dbt compile` | Compile Jinja → SQL, no execution |
| `dbt run` | Execute all models |
| `dbt run -s model_name` | Build a single model |
| `dbt run -s +mart_orders` | Build `mart_orders` and everything upstream |
| `dbt build` | `run` + `test` + `seed` + `snapshot` in DAG order |

*Selectors (`-s`) support `+` for dependencies, `@` for full family, `tag:`, `path:`, and more — we will build on these throughout the course.*

---

## Compiled vs Run SQL

After `dbt compile` or `dbt run`, dbt writes two kinds of output under `target/`:

- **`target/compiled/`** — the SQL **after Jinja rendering**, before execution.
  *Exactly what dbt would send to the warehouse.*
- **`target/run/`** — the SQL **wrapped in the materialization DDL** (e.g. `create table as ...`).
  *The full statement dbt actually executed.*

```bash
target/compiled/dbt_ie/models/staging/stg_customers.sql   # pure SELECT
target/run/dbt_ie/models/staging/stg_customers.sql        # CREATE VIEW ... AS SELECT
```

**Always check compiled SQL when debugging** — it is the ground truth of what your Jinja produced.

---

## Naming Conventions

Consistent naming helps teams collaborate and keeps the DAG readable.

| Layer | Prefix | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Staging | `stg_` | `stg_customers`, `stg_orders` |
| Intermediate | `int_` | `int_order_items_summary` |
| Dimensions | `dim_` | `dim_customers`, `dim_products` |
| Marts / Facts | `mart_` | `mart_orders`, `mart_revenue_by_segment` |

*We will apply these consistently for the rest of the course — they map directly to the three-layer architecture introduced in Session 1.*

- Navigated the dbt project structure and `dbt_project.yml`
- Built our first model and used `ref()` to create a dependency
- Learned the core dbt commands: `debug`, `deps`, `compile`, `run`, `build`
- Inspected compiled vs run SQL in `target/`
